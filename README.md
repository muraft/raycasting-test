## My Ray Casting Project
This ray casting engine is poorly coded because this is my first ray casting engine.\
Features:
- Simple shading
- Texture
- Graphic setting
Cons:
- Very complicated code
- Low performance

### Controls:
- W: Move forward
- A: Move to left
- S: Move backward
- D: Move to right
- Q: Move angle to left
- E: Move angle to right

### Version History
#### First Version
**15th April 2022**\
Very first version, can render the rays perfectly but the shading is very basic, but the problem is the player speed is relative to the minimap size
#### Version 0.2
**16th April 2022**\
Changelog:
- Improve the shading by adjust the color darkness by depth
- Now the player speed is not relative to the minimap size, so you can resize the minimap and it has no effect to the player speed
#### Version 1.0 (A big update)
**08th May 2022**\
Changelog:
- Code refactor
- Add texture
- Add collision detector to player
- Add graphic setting
