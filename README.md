## My Ray Casting Project
This is my first ray casting project, it's poorly designed and has this problem:
- The code is hard to understand
- Player can moves through wall
- The player speed is not relative to the minimap size
- Bad shading (or no shading)
- And other unsolved problem

### Controls:
- W: Move forward
- A: Move to left
- S: Move backward
- D: Move to right
- Q: Move angle to left
- E: Mobe angle to right
