## My Ray Casting Project
So this is my first ray casting project\
features:
- Basic shading (Depth darkness)
More feature is coming soon\
problems:
-Player can move through wall
Future plan:\
- Graphic setting
- Collision detector on the player movement
- Wall texture

### Controls:
- W: Move forward
- A: Move to left
- S: Move backward
- D: Move to right
- Q: Move angle to left
- E: Move angle to right

###Version History
####First Version
**15th April 2022**\
Very first version, can render the rays perfectly but the shading is very basic, but the problem is the player speed is relative to the minimap size
####Version 0.2
**16th April 2022**\
Changelog:
- Improved shading by adjust the color darkness by depth
- Now the player speed is not relative to the minimap size, so you can resize the minimap and it has no effect to the player speed
